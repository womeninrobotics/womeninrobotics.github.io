This year, as we **Shine a Light** on women in robotics, we pause to honor the pioneers who cleared the path we walk today. Decades before robotics programs were widespread and conference halls were diverse, a small cohort of women were already publishing, presenting, and laying the foundations of a field that would reshape industry, medicine, and daily life.

The first International Conference on Robotics and Automation took place in Atlanta Georgia, on March 13-15, 1984, and its [proceedings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087166) are available online. Many of the 1984 authors are now fixtures in the field; Joseph Engelberger, Marc Raibert, Ron Fearing, and Ruzena Bajscy among them. Perhaps less well appreciated is the fact that of the 75 papers, at least 7 authors were women:

- Alicia Casals
- Carol Crawford
- Dianne E. Britton
- Eleanor G. Wells
- Linda Shapiro
- Susan Hackwood
- Ruzena Bajscy
