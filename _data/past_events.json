First, we need many more people to get involved. Celebrations of robotics like the <strong>US National Robotics Week</strong> coming up on April 3-12 aim to increase the number of people (particularly women and underrepresented groups) aspiring to careers in robotics. But we lose women and minorities from the field faster than we add them. So until we’ve addressed the underlying reasons why robotics lacks diversity, while other fields have changed significantly, until we’ve developed an actionable agenda, then we won’t have an inclusive robotics industry. <br><br></div><div><strong>An inclusive robotics industry will be more innovative, but it is harder to achieve. Let’s continue working towards this goal by coming together for an unconference to:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Share our stories</li><li>Find common ground</li><li>Explore the issues</li><li>Relate successes and best practices</li><li>See what works in other places</li></ul><div><br><strong>What is an UNCONFERENCE?<br></strong><br></div><div>An unconference is a participant-driven meeting, organized, structured and led by the people attending it.
