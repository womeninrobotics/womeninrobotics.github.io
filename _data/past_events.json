Diandra lives in Billerica with her husband, Bruno, and daughters Annalise (4) and Carolina (2).  <br><br></div><div><strong>Zoe Snape – Product Architect – Enterprise Software, Vecna Robotics</strong><br>Zoe Snape is the Product Architect for the Enterprise team at Vecna Robotics, supporting client integrations work, and working on scaling up our products and platform. Zoe started out working on the first release of Vecna Robotics's web-based tool used to monitor and administrate robots. From there, she was involved in robotics projects like next-gen VGo, OmniEye, QCArmBot, and more. She grew up in Tacoma, Washington, and got her bachelor's in EECS (6-3 for the MIT crowd) in 2015. Currently, she is in Seattle (working from home for 3 years) with her partner who is currently getting his Ph.D. in Astronomy from UW. In her free time, she loves to bake and go for long walks, work out while watching cartoons, and tend to her pea plants and tomatoes in the balcony.</div><blockquote>\"It's been really cool over the last three years to watch these robots go from being a couple of franken-bots struggling to navigate around cones in an unused corner of someone else's manufacturing facility to a real fleet of dozens of units doing real work at customer sites, with a real manufacturing division, a real support team, and a real deployments team. I'm excited to see where the next three years takes us!\"</blockquote><div><br></div><div><strong>Janani Mohan – Robotics Software Engineer, Vecna Robotics</strong><br>Janani Mohan works as a Robotics Software Engineer at Vecna Robotics. She has a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering specialized in Swarm Robotics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. She was previously employed as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Bosch India. The world of machines and automation has always inspired her and she enjoys making fun hobby projects.

Rus’ research interests are in robotics, artificial intelligence, and data science. The focus of her work is developing the science and engineering of autonomy, toward the long-term objective of enabling a future with machines pervasively integrated into the fabric of life, supporting people with cognitive and physical tasks. Her research addresses some of the gaps between where robots are today and the promise of pervasive robots: increasing the ability of machines to reason, learn, and adapt to complex tasks in human-centered environments, developing intuitive interfaces between robots and people, and creating the tools for designing and fabricating new robots quickly and efficiently. The applications of this work are broad and include transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, construction, monitoring the environment, underwater exploration, smart cities, medicine, and in-home tasks such as cooking. Rus serves as the Associate Director of MIT’s Quest for Intelligence Core, and as Director of the Toyota-CSAIL Joint Research Center, whose focus is the advancement of AI research and its applications to intelligent vehicles. She is a member of the Toyota Research Institute advisory board. Rus is a Class of 2002 MacArthur Fellow, a fellow of ACM, AAAI and IEEE, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is the recipient of the 2017 Engelberger Robotics Award from the Robotics Industries Association. She is a Mitre Senior Visiting Fellow. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University.<br><br></div><div><strong>Clara Vu </strong>has been building autonomous robots for over 20 years. She began her career at iRobot in its early days, where she developed robots for oil well exploration and wrote the programming language behind Roomba. After iRobot’s IPO, she went on to found Harvest Automation, where she led software development for their autonomous agricultural materials handling system. This was the world’s first product that combined fully autonomous mobility and manipulation in an unconstrained environment. Clara connected with Patrick Sobalvarro through Rethink Robots, where she became interested in the challenge of human-robot interaction for manufacturing. As CTO of Veo Robotics, Clara leads the company’s advanced technology development and product roadmap planning to solve fundamental problems in durable goods manufacturing.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid=\"BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI7Z2lkOi8vbWVldGluZ3BsYWNlL0FjdGl2ZVN0b3JhZ2U6OkJsb2IvMjQxMz9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--c2c1ef03e2b13c08d7c79939cdfd97b05f708fbc\" content-type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://meetingplace.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbTBKIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--695aaf1cd0606a99a3fd27af4f83518d37886f5a/Eventbrite%20Header%20-%202160X1080.png\" filename=\"Eventbrite Header - 2160X1080.png\" filesize=\"2052103\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1080\" previewable=\"true\" presentation=\"gallery\"></action-text-attachment></div>",

First, we need many more people to get involved. Celebrations of robotics like the <strong>US National Robotics Week</strong> coming up on April 3-12 aim to increase the number of people (particularly women and underrepresented groups) aspiring to careers in robotics. But we lose women and minorities from the field faster than we add them. So until we’ve addressed the underlying reasons why robotics lacks diversity, while other fields have changed significantly, until we’ve developed an actionable agenda, then we won’t have an inclusive robotics industry. <br><br></div><div><strong>An inclusive robotics industry will be more innovative, but it is harder to achieve.

Coffee followed by hike but it's fine to come just for coffee (and to hang out on the hill as long as you like) if you like picnics better than hiking. Hiking is fairly gentle hills, fire road wide trails. If many come, we'll break into small subgroups based on desired hiking speed/distance and for easy social distancing. It's easy to walk a nice half mile or ten from that trailhead. Be vaxed/boosted, keep 6'-10' apart. Friends, co-workers, and leashed dogs welcome.</div>",

Let's catch up and get to know more about each other, welcome our new members in the group and see what everyone's been up to. Share our thoughts, ideas, inspirations, hybrid/back-to-office routines and issues in robotics. This is a casual conversation to know what all cool projects our fellow roboticists are working on, ask questions, and just have some fun.  If you are interested in organizing events with amazing women in the field to inspire and encourage more women to join the field of robotics, do join us for our upcoming casual talk.<br><strong>Let's talk robotics! </strong></div>",

In addition, we use hardware accelerated versions of the algorithms to increase the throughput. We also explain how to abstract this hardware acceleration in the application code to decouple it from the underlying SoC.</blockquote><div><action-text-attachment sgid=\"BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI7Z2lkOi8vbWVldGluZ3BsYWNlL0FjdGl2ZVN0b3JhZ2U6OkJsb2IvNTcyNz9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--4491c9d4e4d1b75a3b35cd27de757c2b6fe7a75e\" content-type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://meetingplace.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbDhXIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c6542ca6bb0d7a6ed05143b3262c63a577500461/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-25%20at%2012.33.57%20PM.png\" filename=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-25 at 12.33.57 PM.png\" filesize=\"85513\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\" previewable=\"true\" presentation=\"gallery\"></action-text-attachment></div>",
