    Educators everywhere are reexamining and reinventing their teaching approach to meet the challenges of delivering a high-quality education in this unprecedented year. Many are revisiting established best practices while others are looking to new ways of reaching students. In robotics education, we are facing many difficult questions:

    * How can we best engage students in robotics material in the current teaching environment?
    * How can we overcome perceived limitations when teaching robotics content online, especially when hardware is involved?
    * Where should robotics education research focus to address these issues head on?

    To facilitate a conversation around these important questions, the IEEE Women in Engineering - Robotics and Automation Society (WIE-RAS) is hosting an online panel on best practices for teaching robotics.Panelists will share their experience in best practices for robotics education, provide strategies for applying these practices to new courses, discuss major challenges in online robotics education and how they have overcome them, and talk about where they see robotics education headed.
