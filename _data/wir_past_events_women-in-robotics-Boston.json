Rus’ research interests are in robotics, artificial intelligence, and data science. The focus of her work is developing the science and engineering of autonomy, toward the long-term objective of enabling a future with machines pervasively integrated into the fabric of life, supporting people with cognitive and physical tasks. Her research addresses some of the gaps between where robots are today and the promise of pervasive robots: increasing the ability of machines to reason, learn, and adapt to complex tasks in human-centered environments, developing intuitive interfaces between robots and people, and creating the tools for designing and fabricating new robots quickly and efficiently. The applications of this work are broad and include transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, construction, monitoring the environment, underwater exploration, smart cities, medicine, and in-home tasks such as cooking. Rus serves as the Associate Director of MIT’s Quest for Intelligence Core, and as Director of the Toyota-CSAIL Joint Research Center, whose focus is the advancement of AI research and its applications to intelligent vehicles. She is a member of the Toyota Research Institute advisory board. Rus is a Class of 2002 MacArthur Fellow, a fellow of ACM, AAAI and IEEE, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is the recipient of the 2017 Engelberger Robotics Award from the Robotics Industries Association. She is a Mitre Senior Visiting Fellow. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University.<br><br></div><div><strong>Clara Vu </strong>has been building autonomous robots for over 20 years. She began her career at iRobot in its early days, where she developed robots for oil well exploration and wrote the programming language behind Roomba. After iRobot’s IPO, she went on to found Harvest Automation, where she led software development for their autonomous agricultural materials handling system. This was the world’s first product that combined fully autonomous mobility and manipulation in an unconstrained environment. Clara connected with Patrick Sobalvarro through Rethink Robots, where she became interested in the challenge of human-robot interaction for manufacturing. As CTO of Veo Robotics, Clara leads the company’s advanced technology development and product roadmap planning to solve fundamental problems in durable goods manufacturing.<br><br><action-text-attachment sgid=\"BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI7Z2lkOi8vbWVldGluZ3BsYWNlL0FjdGl2ZVN0b3JhZ2U6OkJsb2IvMjQxMz9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--c2c1ef03e2b13c08d7c79939cdfd97b05f708fbc\" content-type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://meetingplace.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbTBKIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--695aaf1cd0606a99a3fd27af4f83518d37886f5a/Eventbrite%20Header%20-%202160X1080.png\" filename=\"Eventbrite Header - 2160X1080.png\" filesize=\"2052103\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1080\" previewable=\"true\" presentation=\"gallery\"></action-text-attachment></div>",
