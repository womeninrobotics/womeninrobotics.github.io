                In celebration of Ada Lovelace Day, we compile a short list every year of some women in robotics that
                everyone should know about.

                From Hypatia to Grace Hopper, there have been amazing women who have fought against massive prejudice to
                carve themselves out a name in the fields of science, engineering, mathematics and technology. These
                comparatively few women however can easily be lost from the pages of history and to create a more equal
                ongoing presence of women in technology, we need to show strong female role models.

                Ada Lovelace was the world’s first computer programmer and in spite of her undoubted mathematical
                brilliance, she was reluctant to publish herself and made do with publishing ‘commentaries’ on the works
                of others. Her commentaries were far longer and more original than the originals and in the process she
                demonstrated the future applications for the universal computing machine that Charles Babbage proposed
                but never built.

                Ada Lovelace Day is about sharing stories of women in science, technology,
                engineering and math who have inspired you to become who you are today. The aim is to create new role
                models for girls and women in these male-dominated fields by raising the profile of other women in STEM.

                Professionally, the women on our list are all field leaders with a huge impact on robotics, regardless
                of their gender. Check back every year for even more inspiration!
