            <p class="sub-title">Women in Robotics is a global community supporting women who work in robotics and women
                who are interested in working in robotics, as entrepreneurs, industry and academia. Our activities
                include local networking events, outreach, education, mentoring, the promotion of positive role
                models in robotics, and just plain fun.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-title">
                We started as a grassroots community to support women in robotics across the globe.
                In 2020 we formed an official 501c3 non-profit organization.

                {{site.data.stats.chapters}} active chapters. There interest in having Women in Robotics meetups in
                countries covering all the continents except Antarctica (but maybe one day!).
