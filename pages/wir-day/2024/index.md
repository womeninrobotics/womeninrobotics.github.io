## October 2th

On Women in Robotics Day 2024, we shine a light on the often overlooked innovators and pioneers whose visionary ideas and contributions have been instrumental in propelling the field of robotics forward. These unsung women in robotics have defied stereotypes, blazed trails, and solved complex challenges - yet their stories have gone largely untold.

Today, we **shine a light** on these remarkable women and their achievements. From academic researchers and entrepreneurial founders to factory engineers and inspiring educators, we celebrate the diverse impact of women across all areas of robotics.

Join us in this celebration by honoring the women roboticists in your communities, organizations and networks. Host events, share their stories widely, and inspire the next generation to follow in their footsteps. Together, we can foster greater recognition for women and support a future where diverse talents drive robotics innovation.

Whose story will you shine a light on today? Tag #ShineALight to spotlight the women in robotics you know who are transforming our world.
