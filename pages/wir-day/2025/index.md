## October 1st

On October 1, 2025, we’re celebrating International Women in Robotics Day.  This day acts as a global moment to recognize and amplify the women building our robotic future. In every corner of the field, women are pushing robotics forward - it's time we recognize them.

This day exists to make that work visible. We invite individuals and organizations to spotlight the women behind the robots: host an event, share photos from your teams and labs, and help broaden the stories people see when they think “robotics.” Visibility matters—especially for the next generation deciding where they belong.

Women in Robotics champions this visibility year-round through our projects [Inspire](/project-inspire), [Connect](/project-connect), and [Advance](/project-advance). WIR Day brings them together in one shared call to action. Whether you’re new to our community or a long-time member, October 1 is your perfect on-ramp: celebrate, share, and help us grow opportunity for women in the field.
