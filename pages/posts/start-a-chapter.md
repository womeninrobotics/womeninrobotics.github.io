## What is Women in Robotics?

Women in Robotics is a global community supporting women who work in robotics and women
who are interested in working in robotics, as entrepreneurs, industry and academia. Our activities
include local networking events, outreach, education, mentoring, the promotion of positive role
models in robotics, and just plain fun.

We started as a grassroots community to support women in robotics across the globe.
In 2020 we formed an official 501c3 non-profit organization.

We have over {{ site.data.stats.members }} members in the online community and
{{site.data.stats.chapters}} active chapters. There interest in having Women in Robotics meetups in
countries covering all the continents except Antarctica (but maybe one day!).

### Our mission

The mission of Women in Robotics is to support women working in robotics and women who aspire to work in
