How can women feel as if they belong in robotics if we can’t see any pictures of women building or programming robots? The Civil Rights Activist Marian Wright Edelman aptly said, “You can’t be what you can’t see.” We’d like you all to take photos of women building and coding robots and share them with us!

Here’s a [handy guide](https://svrobo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Women-in-Robotics-Photo-Challenge.pdf) to what a great photo looks like with some awesome examples. This is a great opportunity for research labs and robotics companies to showcase their talented women and other underrepresented groups.

If you’ve ever searched for images of **women building robots**{:.text-primary } to promote your inclusive activities,  you know just how few suitable images are available online. 

Let’s make women working in robotics **more visible**{:.text-primary}.  Let’s help make it **more desirable**{:.text-primary} for women to work in robotics and for companies/labs to showcase women (and nonbinary and underrepresented people!) and let’s **inspire, connect and advance the women that are working in robotics and the women who’d like to work in robotics**{:.text-primary}.

## What makes a great photo?

* Real robot/programming (not toy/sci-fi robot)
* Adult (not school age)
* An active single subject at the forefront of the image (not a group of people)
* The subject is using tools, code, or sensors to build or deploy robots.
* Unbranded image (small logos in background ok)
* Permission from subject
