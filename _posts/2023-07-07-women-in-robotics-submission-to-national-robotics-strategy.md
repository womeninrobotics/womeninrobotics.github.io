Women in Robotics made a submission in May 2023 to Australia’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources on the National Robotics Strategy Discussion Paper. Reflecting the views of 15 of the Australians on the Women in Robotics global annual list of “Women in Robotics you need to know about”, the strategy makes recommendations on how to address diversity in robotics. "It’s critical for Australia as a nation to be proactive against the “Brain Drain” of talented women, and likewise against attrition of “atypical roboticists” at all career stages."
