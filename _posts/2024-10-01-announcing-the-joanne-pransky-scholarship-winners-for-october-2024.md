The **[Joanne Pransky Scholarship](https://bold.org/funds/women-in-robotics-scholarship-fund/)** was established to honor the legacy of **[Joanne Pransky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Pransky)**, a pioneer and advocate for women in robotics. This scholarship supports young women pursuing careers in robotics and aims to foster inclusivity and diversity in the field.

We are very grateful to all of Joanne’s friends and family for their contributions to the fund, and want to call out **[The Joseph F. Engelberger Foundation](https://www.automate.org/robotics/engelberger/the-joseph-f-engelberger-foundation-robotics-grants)** and **[A3, the Association for Advancing Automation](https://www.automate.org/robotics)** for their very generous donations!

Joseph Engelberger is renowned as the “Father of Robotics” creating the first commercial robot arm company in 1961. Engelberger later moved on to creating the first service robot called HelpMate, and one of his key team members was a woman, Bala Krishnamurthy, who was the chief software and navigation engineer. Bala Krishnamurthy was featured in our **[“2020 women in robotics you need to know about”](https://svrobo.org/30-women-in-robotics-you-need-to-know-about-2020-robohub/)** list.

The **[Joanne Pransky Scholarship](https://bold.org/scholarships/joanne-pransky-celebration-of-women-in-robotics/)** is open to juniors, seniors, and undergraduates and now to graduate students who demonstrate exceptional talent and dedication in robotics, particularly students who have overcome difficulty to pursue their dreams. The next round of scholarships is now open with a deadline of February 1st 2025.

## About the Winners:

<https://youtu.be/Lg-6VVEMuE8>

> I am absolutely overjoyed and deeply humbled to be selected as this year’s winner. As a Sri Lankan undergraduate student at Yale studying electrical engineering, this recognition feels particularly meaningful. It has been a journey shaped by curiosity and passion for robotics, and being acknowledged in this way is a profound honor. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and the platform you provide to celebrate the achievements of women in robotics. This award strengthens my commitment to contribute meaningfully to the field, especially as someone from a background that is often underrepresented in STEM. Thank you for inspiring and supporting women like me, and for the work you do to elevate diversity in robotics.

### Amadie Gajanaike, Yale University

Amadie is no stranger to winning prizes for excellence but the judges were particularly impressed by her passion for advocacy and philanthropy.

#### Wisena Joseph, Northeastern University

I am determined to continue my pursuit of higher education in the field of engineering, specifically in robotics. I want to understand the different aspects of constructing a technology such as its manufacturing, circuitry, and programming; thus, robotics. My goal is to be able to solve societal issues such as aid for the elderly by providing engineering solutions such as domestic robotics. As a low-income student, I plan to use the scholarships here to be a foundational step in my career.
