The Women in Robotics ’50 women in robotics you need to know about’ list always features someone who is creative with robots, an artist, author or creator and this year not only do we have an award winning poet and author, but half a dozen other women who expand our knowledge of robots and robotics through the power of the word.

[Dr ](https://www.janeyolen.com/)[Jane Yolen](https://www.janeyolen.com/) is the author of ‘The Last Robot’ the titular poem from her 2021 chapbook (short book) of science fiction poetry, which won the Elgin Award in 2023. Some of the poetry speaks to the impact of light polluted skies on our dreams of other worlds, or Titan’s lakes or an Ode to Cassini or the Curiosity Rover. The Robot Suite ends with The Last Robot, a haunting zeitgeist.

> "Some creatures are a mystery,

> ready to work for nothing
