The first International Conference on Robotics and Automation was held in Atlanta Georgia from March 13-15 1984 and you can still read the [proceedings of the conference here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087166). Many of the 1984 authors are still very well known in robotics, for example, Joseph Engelberger, Marc Raibert, Ron Fearing, and Ruzena Bajscy. Perhaps less well appreciated is the fact that of the 75 papers, at least 7 authors were women:

* Alicia Casals * 2014
* Carol Crawford * 2024
* Dianne E. Britton * 2024
* Eleanor G. Wells * 2024
* Linda Shapiro * 2024
* Susan Hackwood * 2024
* Ruzena Bajscy * 2014

Both Alicia Casals and Ruzena Bajscy were featured in our ["2014 Women in Robotics You Need To Know About"](https://www.womeninrobotics.org/wir-list/2014) list, as well as keynoting the [ICRA@40](https://icra40.ieee.org/) celebrations in Rotterdam in September 2024. The other five women are part of our 2024 Women in Robotics list, and we'll be sharing parts of the 2024 list all the way through October.

![Ruzena Bajscy](/assets/images/ruzena_bajcsy.jpg "Ruzena Bajscy")

Throughout her long and influential career, Ruzena Bajcsy has been a pioneer in machine perception, robotics, and artificial intelligence, introducing entire fields that today are taken for granted as important research areas. She is particularly well known for two concepts. The first, known as "active perception," revolutionized robotic vision and sensing. Until 1988, the paradigm in robotic vision was to interpret what one was perceiving based on the composition and computer analysis of a few images taken from static cameras and sensors. Bajcsy suggested that the more effective method of moving the sensors would help the machine gather more information and the sensors, in turn, could help streamline movement. This paradigm of vision as an active process has become the leading theory in understanding human vision as well—emphasizing the surprising cross-disciplinary nature of much of Bajcsy's work.

The second contribution for which Bajcsy is well-known, elastic matching, has transformed medical imaging. This work matches up defined points on anatomical structures and organs to automatically align, measure, and analyze the uniquely-shaped body parts of any individual. By elastically massaging such "deformed" images to match idealized medical images, a computer can identify body parts and help spot anomalies or problems. This has particularly influenced non-invasive measurements of brain structure and function.

Bajcsy's awards include: the Allen Newell Award, the Computing Research Associates Distinguished Service Award, the IEEE Innovation in Healthcare Technology Medal, and the ACM Distinguished Service Award. She is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine. In 2002, she was named one of the 50 most important women in science by Discover Magazine. In 2009, she became a [Benjamin Franklin Medal Laureate,](https://fi.edu/en/awards/laureates/ruzena-bajcsy) in 2022, she received the [Slovak Medal of Honor .](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/news/ruzena-bajcsy-receives-slovak-medal-honor/)

> “Many people think of robotics as mechanical things, but robotics is also perception – and communication between machines.” – Ruzena Bajcsy

At a time when robotic science concretely divided research subjects between planning, sensing, and control, Ruzena Bajcsy insisted on bringing the disciplines together. Bajcsy realized that in order for robots to perceive their surroundings effectively they needed to act more like humans. Instead of thinking of sensing as a passive process where images and sensor measurements were acquired by static sensors, she developed robots that improved their perception of the world by actively moving their cameras and sensors and by reaching and touching. (Computer vision could not be improved, for example, by mere analysis of a static image--—instead sensors needed to move around, change their focal length or change the lighting to gather as much data from as many perspectives as possible). It seems self-evident now, but in the 1980s when Bajcsy first suggested the concept of "active perception," it revolutionized the robotics field. Later, she drew upon similar cross-disciplinary research—including computer science and biomechanics -- to overturn the way software analyzed and manipulated medical images.

Ruzena Bajcsy received her master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Slovak Technical University in Bratislava in 1957 and 1967, respectively. During this time she also taught math and computer science there. Bajcsy went on to Stanford where she earned a Ph.D. in computer science in 1972 with John McCarthy has her thesis advisor. She became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania in 1977, and was chair of the computer and information science department 13 years later—the first woman in that position. In 1979 she founded the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Lab at Penn, which remains a major lab in the field even after her "retirement" in 2001. Subsequently, Bajcsy spent two years working for the NSF before founding UC Berkeley's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society \[CITRIS], where she is now director emeritus.

The women we feature show that glass ceilings are made to be broken, but the women who we can't find or feature show that a career in robotics is still very far from easy. Our latest research dug deep into statistics about women in robotics across all of the STEM fields and found that it's still not a great career choice for women. **Women that are still in robotics after 15 years are exceptional exceptions!**
