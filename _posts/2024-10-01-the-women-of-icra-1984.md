The first International Conference on Robotics and Automation was held in Atlanta Georgia from March 13-15 1984 and you can still read the [proceedings of the conference here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1087166). Many of the 1984 authors are still very well known in robotics, for example, Joseph Engelberger, Marc Raibert, Ron Fearing, and Ruzena Bajscy. Perhaps less well appreciated is the fact that of the 75 papers, at least 7 authors were women:

* Alicia Casals * 2014
* Carol Crawford * 2024
* Dianne E. Britton * 2024
* Eleanor G. Wells * 2024
* Linda Shapiro * 2024
* Susan Hackwood * 2024
*  Ruzena Bajscy * 2014

Both Alicia Casals and Ruzena Bajscy were featured in our ["2014 Women in Robotics You Need To Know About"](https://www.womeninrobotics.org/wir-list/2014) list, as well as keynoting the [ICRA@40](https://icra40.ieee.org/) celebrations in Rotterdam in September 2024. The other five women are part of our 2024 Women in Robotics list, and we'll be sharing parts of the 2024 list all the way through October.

[Professor Alicia Casals](https://www.hamlynsymposium.org/people/dr-alicia-casals/) is the head of the reseach group on Robotics and Compute Vision of the Center of Research in Biomedical Engineering (CREB) at UPC, the Technical University of Catalonia. Casals is also the cofounder of two companies in medical robotics, turning research robots into real products. Since featuring in our ["2014 Women in Robotics You Need To Know About"](https://www.womeninrobotics.org/wir-list/2014) list, she was interviewed by Selma Sabanovich for the [Engineering and Technology History Wiki](https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Alicia_Casals) and the [IEEE RAS Robotics History Project](https://www.ieee-ras.org/roboticshistory/roboticist-detail/roboticistprofile.html?profileid=109), and in 2022 she received the Honor Medal from the Xarxa Vives d’Universitats, the network of 22 universities from the Catalan Countries. 



![Carol Crawford](/assets/images/carol-crawford-obituary.jpeg "Carol Crawford 1951-2021")

[Dr Carol Crawford](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/citizensvoice/name/carol-crawford-obituary?id=12415610)'s areas of research included robotics, artificial intelligence and computer vision. Her research was supported by grants from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Naval Research and NASA. She was one of only 20 scientists in the nation to be choses as a NASA research fellow at the Johnson Space Center. Crawford earned a PhD in mathematics with distinction from Georgetown University, before becoming a full professor of mathematics at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD. She was selected as a Fellow of the Institute for Combinatorics, Canada and was named Professor Emerita, Mathematics on retirement after almost 30 years at the United States Naval Academy.

Sadly we couldn't find any information about Diane E. Britton or Eleanore G. Wells, except for their affiliation with RCA Laboratories. They are two of the authors of the ICRA 1984 paper on Coordination Software for Robotic Workcells. [ICRA 1984](https://dblp.org/db/conf/icra/icra1984.html#BairdWB84): 354-360: [Henry S. Baird](https://dblp.org/pid/90/365.html), [Eleanore G. Wells](https://dblp.org/pid/191/1137.html), [Dianne E. Britton](https://dblp.org/pid/55/894.html).  Please let us know if you have more details.







![Susan Hackwood](/assets/images/susan-hackwood.jpeg "Susan Hackwood")

[Professor Emeritus Susan Hackwood](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/hackwood) is a Senior Policy Fellow at the School of Public Policy and Director of the Science to Policy (S2P) program at the University of California, Riverside. Prior to her current role she served as Executive Director of the California Council on Science and Technology (CCST) for over two decades, advising the state on various aspects of science and technology, including biotechnology, nanotechnology, climate change, disaster prevention, technical workforce development and education.

Hackwood gained her Ph.D. in Solid State Ionics from DeMontfort University, UK and has held various positions in industry and academia. She was the Department Head of Device Robotics Technology Research at AT&T Bell Labs, where she invented and named the electrowetting effect. Later she joined the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she founded the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Robotics Systems in Microelectronics.

As the founding Dean of the Bourns College of Engineering at UC Riverside, she founded the Center for Environmental Research Technology and pioneered research in swarm intelligence technologies. She is a Fellow of the IEEE and the AAAS, and she works closely in partnership with industry, academia and government to address policy issues of societal importance.
