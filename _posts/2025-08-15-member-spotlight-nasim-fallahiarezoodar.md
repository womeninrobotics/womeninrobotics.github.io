**What is your background?**

I am originally from the Iran, and my path into aerospace engineering began almost by chance when I started my undergraduate studies. What began as an unexpected choice quickly became a passion, and I continued to build my expertise through research and advanced studies. Over time, my interests evolved toward robotics in space applications, which led me to pursue my PhD, focusing on cooperative control of dual-arm space manipulators for tasks like space debris removal and on-orbit assembly.

**How did you get into robotics?**

I began in space engineering, working primarily on satellite technology. Over time, I became increasingly fascinated by how robotic systems could operate autonomously in complex, uncertain environments—especially in space.\
\
This curiosity led me to pursue a PhD in space robotics, where I now focus on cooperative control of dual-arm space manipulators.

**What do you currently do in robotics?**

 My current project involves developing and testing advanced control algorithms for a dual-arm space robot mounted on an air-bearing platform, which simulates microgravity conditions.\
\
In this work, I integrate AI-based techniques—such as reinforcement learning and intelligent control methods—with classical control theory to achieve coordinated, precise manipulation of both arms for complex tasks. This system is particularly crucial because it can be applied to pressing space applications such as space debris removal and on-orbit assembly, both of which are key to enabling sustainable space operations. My research bridges theoretical modeling, simulation, and experimental validation on the physical platform, aiming to advance the autonomy, robustness, and adaptability of on-orbit servicing robots.

**What excites you the most about the future of robotics?**

For me, the most inspiring part is seeing how robotics can address urgent global challenges—whether it’s enabling sustainable space exploration, performing delicate surgeries, supporting disaster response, or automating dangerous industrial tasks. In my own field of space robotics, I’m especially excited about how autonomous systems will make on-orbit assembly, space debris removal, and planetary exploration safer and more achievable.

**Describe something that you do (or would like to do) to help support younger women in robotics?**

As a young woman in the field of robotics, I believe that having an active, supportive community is essential for encouraging more women to join and thrive in this area. I envision a global network where members can learn from each other, share experiences, and build strong professional connections.\
\
This community could offer accessible robotics courses, host weekly virtual meetings where people from around the world discuss their work and challenges, and provide mentorship opportunities. Industry professionals could share their insights on advancing in the field and navigating the hiring process.\
\
By creating a space where knowledge, experience, and opportunities are openly shared, we can inspire more young women to see themselves as robotics engineers. As this community grows, we can support one another, break down barriers, and advance together—hand in hand.
