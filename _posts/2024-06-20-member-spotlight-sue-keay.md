In our latest Women in Robotics spotlight, we had the privilege of interviewing Sue Keay, a pioneering figure in Australia's robotics industry. She even recently won the **“[50 remarkable and inspirational women in Australian science](https://cosmosmagazine.com/people/society/50-remarkable-and-inspirational-women-in-australian-science/)”** list from Cosmos Magazine**.** From her beginnings as a research scientist in isotope geochemistry to becoming a driving force in robotics research management and commercialization, Sue shares her journey and insights on navigating the intersection of technology, industry, and sustainability. 

Discover how she's shaping the future of robotics in Australia and beyond, and her dedication to empowering the next generation of women in tech.

**What is your background?**

I am a research scientist (isotope geochemistry) who moved into research management and commercialisation and now work in industry.  My background is as a geologist so I maintain a lot of links with the mining industry and was recently working for a copper mining company looking at how to increase the speed with which they are adopting robotics. My passion project is building a sustainable robotics industry in Australia. This stems from my work producing Australia's robotics roadmaps, trying to catalogue the country's robotics capability and what opportunities this presents.


**How did you get into robotics?**

It's my sister's fault. I had zero interest in robotics. My older sister, Andra Keay, would often talk about robotics and as the younger sister I felt duty bound to ignore anything she said. However an opportunity came up for me to help set-up the world's first robotic vision research centre so I thought I should start paying attention and reached out to Andra for some advice and that was how I got my start in robotics more than a decade ago now...


**What do you currently do in robotics?**

I am a consultant, board director and advisor helping the companies that build robots as well as the companies trying to navigate what emerging technologies mean for their business. In my spare time I am the Chair of the Board of Directors for Robotics Australia Group, the voice for robotics in Australia. Recently I was advising the Australian government on the development of our first national robotics strategy (to be released soon). I do technical and commercial feasibility studies for technology companies and develop automation roadmaps for businesses that also look at the future of work and how automation plays a role in decarbonisation. I'm passionate about helping companies to embrace the opportunities that new technologies can bring while also empowering the workforce to operate to their full potential and learn new things. 


**What is your favorite and least favorite thing about robotics?**

I love nothing more than the opportunity to learn about the interesting work being done by robotics companies. The enormous range of solutions provided by clever application of robots is my absolute favourite thing and gives me hope for the future. My least favourite thing is how male-dominated the industry is and I often wonder how many solutions we are missing out on because the problem space is only viewed through the lens of one gender. Do we really need robots that can make pizza?  Is that seriously a problem worth solving? How about we solve some problems like preserving our natural environment and mitigating the impact of climate change instead? Or helping people stay in their own homes as they age?  Protecting women and children from domestic violence? The list goes on...


**What excites you the most about the future of robotics?**

It's probably a cliche now but the ability of robots to augment human potential and to scale solutions. We haven't got there yet but there are so many problems in the world that we have not been able to solve using humans alone.  The one example that is close to my heart, as I live near one of the world's natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef, is the development of underwater robots that can help eradicate pests that are destroying coral, and collect coral spawn and replanting corals to help rejuvenate the reef, which is otherwise struggling to survive. The Great Barrier Reef covers an area the size of Italy and currently these type of solutions are being supplied by the occasional human diver. When we have a good robot solution and when we have the opportunity to scale that solution I think we can do a lot of good in the world.


**Describe a time when someone made a real difference in your career, and what did they say, or do for you?**

I need to credit my sister Andra for giving me the initial push into robotics, for including me in the Women in Robotics community, and for always being there when I need help. She really is an inspirational role model and as someone who has always worked in male dominated areas I often find role models are in short supply. Andra works incredibly hard to build community and I'd love to be able to replicate the impact she has had in robotics in my own small way on the other side of the world (Andra is based in the US while I am in Australia).


**Describe something that you do (or would like to do) to help support younger women in robotics?**

I do a lot of mentoring of younger women but not many in robotics. We are still a small community in Australia but when we do get the opportunity to get together it is always fun. I'd love to be able to do more of that!
